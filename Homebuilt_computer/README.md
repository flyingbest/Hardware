### Precautions

Things to check before purchasing an custom-built computer. You need to find out if all products are compatible. Check this list.

- [x] Make sure that the motherboard socket matches the CPU socket.
- [x] Make sure the motherboard chipset supports the corresponding CPU.
- [x] Make sure the memory is compatible with the CPU generation and mainboard.
- [x] Check if the memory clock is supported by the motherboard.
- [x] The output power should be higher than the total power consumption of PC parts.
- [x] Purchase 80-PLUS certified power whenever possible.
- [x] You should choose a case considering the size of the graphics card, the CPU cooler, and the size of the motherboard.

### CPU

Basically, there are Intel and AMD. intel i3, i5, i7 : this all build-in graphics. Xeon Processor is removed the graphical features and made them available to the server. More about Intel Architecture.
> i7-ABCDK 4.00GHZ   
> A : Generation. higher is better.  
> BCD : Performance. higher is better.  
> K : OverClock.   
> 4.00 : Clock. higer is better.  

Architecture | Generation 
----- | ----- 
Nehalem | 1 (2008) 
Sandybridge | 2 (2011)
Ivybridge | 3 (2012)
Haswell | 4 (2013)
Haswell refresh | 4 (2014)
Devil's Canyon | 4 (2014)
Broadwell | 5 (2014)
Sky lake | 6 (2015)
Kaby lake | 7 (2016)
Canon lake | 8 (2017)

### Graphic Card

Basically, there are Geforce and AMD. A graphic card is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display (such as a computer monitor). It is called an external graphics card and converts it into a video signal that can view digital data and transmit it to a monitor. GPU, video memory, and monitor output.
> GTX 960 Strix D5
> GTX : Series. high grade.  
> 9 : Generation. higher is better.  
> 60 : Performance. higher is better.   

### Memory Card (RAM)

Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system.
> DDR3 2400MHz PC3-12800 8GB
> DDR3 : Generation.  
> 2400MHz : memory speed.  
> PC3 : pc3 is DDR3. pc4 is DDR4.  
> 12800 : Data rate per second.  
> 8GB : Volume.  

### Motherboard (Mainboard)

A motherboard is the main printed circuit board(PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. There are MINI-ITX, M-ITX, and ATX types of motherboard.  
The motherboard is divided into size, chipset, CPU socket, and RAM slot.


### Power Supply

A power supply is an electronic device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load. There are TFX, M-ATX, and ATX types of power supply. It is divided into General Configuration, Modular, and Full modular according to the line connection.  

### PC Case

In public, it is divided into Slim, Mini-tower, Middle-tower, and Big-tower according to the size.
