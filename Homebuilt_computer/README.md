## Precautions before purchase

Things to check before purchasing an custom-built computer. You need to find out if all products are compatible. Check this list.

- [x] Make sure that the motherboard socket matches the CPU socket.
- [x] Make sure the motherboard chipset supports the corresponding CPU.
- [x] Make sure the memory is compatible with the CPU generation and mainboard.
- [x] Check if the memory clock is supported by the motherboard.
- [x] The output power should be higher than the total power consumption of PC parts.
- [x] Purchase 80-PLUS certified power whenever possible.
- [x] You should choose a case considering the size of the graphics card, the CPU cooler, and the size of the motherboard.

## Computer Hardware Brief instruction 

* __CPU__

Basically, there are Intel and AMD. intel i3, i5, i7 : this all build-in graphics. Xeon Processor is removed the graphical features and made them available to the server. More about Intel Architecture.
> i7-4790K 4.40GHz   
> 4 : Generation. higher is better.  
> 790 : Performance. higher is better.  
> K : OverClock. X : Extreme. S : Performance. T : Low power. None : Basic.  
> 4.40 : Clock. higer is better.

* __Motherboard (Mainboard)__

A motherboard is the main printed circuit board(PCB) found in general purpose microcomputers and other expandable systems. There are MINI-ITX, M-ITX, and ATX types of motherboard.  
The motherboard is divided into size, chipset, CPU socket, and RAM slot.

* __Graphic Card__

Basically, there are Geforce and AMD. A graphic card is an expansion card which generates a feed of output images to a display (such as a computer monitor). It is called an external graphics card and converts it into a video signal that can view digital data and transmit it to a monitor. GPU, video memory, and monitor output.
> GTX 960   
> GTX : Series. high grade.  
> 9 : Generation. higher is better.  
> 60 : Performance. higher is better.   

* __Memory Card (RAM)__

Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system.
> DDR3 2400MHz PC3-12800 8GB
> DDR3 : Generation.  
> 2400MHz : memory speed.  
> PC3 : pc3 is DDR3. pc4 is DDR4.  
> 12800 : Data rate per second.  
> 8GB : Volume.  

* __SSD / HDD__

A solid-state drive is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently.  
A hard disk drive is a data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and retrieve digital information using one or more rigid rapidly rotating disks coated with magnetic material.  
I installed windows 8 pro as the default operating system on the SSD, and the HDD is being used as the D:/ drive.

* __Power Supply__

A power supply is an electronic device that supplies electric energy to an electrical load. There are TFX, M-ATX, and ATX types of power supply. It is divided into General Configuration, Modular, and Full modular according to the line connection.  

* __PC Case__

In public, it is divided into Slim, Mini-tower, Middle-tower, and Big-tower according to the size. 

## Current Computer System Environment

Keep updating my homebuilt computer system. (Big Configuration.)

## Problems occur (with date) 

1. **Booting failure** (Monday, 01-30-2017, 21:00) 

	When I press the power of the computer, it tries to boot, and it goes out again in 2 seconds. Repeat this operation continuously. _**This problem has continued occured not only on this day but also before.**_  

2. **problem title...**



## Trouble Shooting (with period)

1. **Booting failure Troubleshooting** (Monday, 01-30-2017, 21:30 ~ Tuesday, 01-31-2017, 11:00)

	- Possible Cause
		1. dust problem 
		2. during cleaning, liquids on graphic card
		3. motherboard issues
		4. power-supply issues
		5. cpu issues

	- Correction
		1. I don't think so. because I have been removing all the dust just before booting. 	
		2. I had to disassemble the computer to see the problems from b to e.  
		3. 

		Procedure | Action | Confirm 
		----- | ----- | -----
		1. | Make sure that only the motherboard with CPU is connected to the power to boot. | [o]
		2. | Mount the RAM on the motherboard and check if it is bootable. | [o] 
		3. | After installing the graphics card on the motherboard, check if it can boot. | [o]
		4. | After installing the SSD and HDD on the motherboard, check if it is bootable. | [o]
		5. | After connecting the four fans to the power, make sure that the computer boots up. | [o]
		6. | After connecting the external USB 3.0x2, 2.0x2 ports, mike, and earphone jack, check if it is bootable. | [x]

	-	**Conclusion**  
		I finally concluded that power would be a problem. Theoretically, the consumption power was not greater than the output power, but since it was booted after being installed sequentially from the beginning, the consumption power was higher.

	- _**Solution**_  
		Removed unnecessary parts and reassembled them with only the necessary ones.  
		Necessary ones : (CPU, Motherboard, RAM, Graphic card, SSD, HDD, 2Fans, Power-supply).  
		Un-necessary ones : (External USB ports, 2Fans, earphone jack, mike etc).  

2. **Title Trobleshooting...**
